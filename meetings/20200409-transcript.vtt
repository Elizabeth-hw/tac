1
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.090
Yeah.

2
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.250
Mike Friesenegger: How are you sir.

3
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.920
John Mertic: A little crazy busy at the moment, um,

4
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.080
John Mertic: Yeah, there's

5
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.960
John Mertic: A big announcement that is should be landing here in the next 45 minutes that

6
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.560
John Mertic: My last 18 hours.

7
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:38.160
Mike Friesenegger: Oh, okay. Well, so my CTO who's on my CTO just ping me about something and maybe related to that.

8
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.870
John Mertic: It is, yes.

9
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.990
Mike Friesenegger: Okay, yes, I'm somewhat aware of it.

10
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.380
John Mertic: Yep, yep, and it should be really great. I mean, once it lands.

11
00:10:46.410 --> 00:11:01.290
John Mertic: Yeah, don't get me wrong, but it's it's been it's been a little bit of a roller coaster. But I think it's gonna be really exciting. We're just waiting for a few last pieces to drop and I really appreciate how like accommodating Susie has been with all this. Yeah.

12
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.310
John Mertic: AC and Sarah.

13
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:07.530
John Mertic: And fantastic. And thank you also do CTO and everything for making that happen. Yes.

14
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:13.140
Mike Friesenegger: No problem. Happy to help you ping me and said I had to do some quick research and get an answer back to them.

15
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:21.690
Mike Friesenegger: Yeah. And thanks, I was surprised you because you emailed me last night. It was must have been close to midnight your time.

16
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:22.950
John Mertic: Yeah, it's about right.

17
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:31.050
Mike Friesenegger: Yeah, so thank you for thank you for fixing that. Because that was the last piece of stuff that I needed to add to the presentation for next week.

18
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:35.580
John Mertic: Oh, good. Oh, good. Okay, cool. I'm glad that's coming together. Yeah.

19
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.110
Mike Friesenegger: Okay.

20
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.290
John Mertic: Excellent. I see. Bob in the background.

21
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.760
Bob Dahlberg: Yep, I'm here.

22
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.560
John Mertic: I think everyone's gonna be a little bit late today because of the adding zoom

23
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.890
John Mertic: Login you having me create a zoom account so

24
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.940
John Mertic: Might be running a bit behind schedule.

25
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:54.570
Mike Friesenegger: So we won't

26
00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:04.470
Mike Friesenegger: So we won't get all of those zoom messages that say meetings are started meeting attendees are waiting and all that kind of stuff. At least that's the hope by doing this.

27
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:13.140
John Mertic: Um, so you probably still get those. I think so. I think the things that we're, we're trying to eliminate with this is

28
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:20.850
John Mertic: The casual drive by zoom bomber that just get some meeting ID and then just goes in science on

29
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.840
Mike Friesenegger: Oh, okay.

30
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.490
John Mertic: Um, and then does something so at least people have to do a little bit of work.

31
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:31.200
John Mertic: To do it. Um, but yeah hopefully it will be some other so

32
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.480
Bob Dahlberg: What they've done for us as they've a instant zoom has instituted the waiting room for us.

33
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:49.260
Bob Dahlberg: Yeah, so that that that cuts down to but zoom had the ability of just be you didn't have to have zoom installed, like you said, you just get to it from my browser. But they we've disabled, that if he co

34
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:59.340
John Mertic: UK okay yeah we were, I think we're playing with still with a little bit of settings. Um, I don't, I don't think we have it all the way figured out

35
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:06.000
John Mertic: The waiting room that's that's kind of nice. If you can't do it with a webcast, because of course

36
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:12.090
Bob Dahlberg: Well, I guess you could, but it would be nice to be able to, you know, you have to individually accept people into the

37
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:26.340
John Mertic: We yeah we thought about that. Um, that was the sort of my big concern there is are we adding a lot of too much overhead for not as much value. So I think that was that's always the trade off with these things. Right, so

38
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.870
Bob Dahlberg: It depends how paranoid. Yeah.

39
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.700
John Mertic: Well, there is that, I mean, that's sort of the thing that I try to share with everyone when they

40
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:41.220
John Mertic: Start to, you know, express though, you know, what is wrong with zoom. They have none of their stuff available. I'm like, you know, here's the truth. None of these platforms are all that great.

41
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:49.410
Bob Dahlberg: Yeah, I've always said that disabilities that that helps you decide what type of job you should go into if you're paranoid, you become a security guy.

42
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:53.280
Bob Dahlberg: If you're, if you're OCD, you can become a project manager.

43
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.890
Bob Dahlberg: If you're Asperger's, you become a developer right

44
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.560
phil.tully@adp.com: That's the new requirements for programming.

45
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.220
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Good morning everyone. So you're from IBM

46
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.350
phil.tully@adp.com: Do you hear me.

47
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.080
Mike Friesenegger: Yeah, we can hear you. Okay. Wasn't sure I

48
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:47.400
phil.tully@adp.com: Go.

49
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.420
John Mertic: Here and started to step away there Lynn was calling to try to see how to create a zoom account.

50
00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:07.680
John Mertic: Or traveling. We have a couple more minutes I imagined for several view, there's a little bit of work and getting a zoom account going so

51
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.400
John Mertic: If we sort of anticipate would be a little bit behind today.

52
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:40.200
phil.tully@adp.com: Same issue with me if I can't install the software on my laptop. I can only run it from the browser. So

53
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.230
John Mertic: Yeah, that is true.

54
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.690
John Mertic: Actually, I think that's becoming

55
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:47.340
John Mertic: Older more prevalent. I think I saw something good.

56
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:52.560
John Mertic: Google's banning employees from Sony zoom on their things they can only join to the browser.

57
00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:00.900
phil.tully@adp.com: Well, I wouldn't need admin access and I can get it temporarily, but it's too much of a hassle.

58
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.310
phil.tully@adp.com: And I'm blaming

59
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.210
And blaming

60
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.250
John Mertic: All right.

61
00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.210
John Mertic: I'm

62
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:14.070
John Mertic: Just looking here is corn. I think we're like one or two short a Korean here.

63
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:26.370
John Mertic: But I'm wondering maybe just in lieu of time here since the first top of the meeting is kind of just going through project updates. Anyways, if we want to just kind of get rolling within their. What are your thoughts, Phil.

64
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.200
That's why.

65
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:32.700
John Mertic: Okay.

66
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:40.170
John Mertic: Lead drop in the chat here real quick. The meeting agenda.

67
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.840
John Mertic: I dance lab.

68
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.210
John Mertic: Hey, you're the 804 number dialing in

69
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.320
18049181726: That's me.

70
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.600
John Mertic: Okay, cool, cool. Thank you.

71
00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.760
John Mertic: Thank you so much for that.

72
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.150
John Mertic: All right, I just, I'm

73
00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:01.140
John Mertic: Just talk to the link here in the chat for the meeting agenda here for today. I'm

74
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:10.830
John Mertic: Phil, I hate to necessarily put you on the spot here, but I'm trying to balance something quick here in the background. Would you mind sort of leading through the the project updates.

75
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.000
John Mertic: Oh, Phil, I don't know you're on mute, at the moment.

76
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:27.990
18049181726: Sorry about that.

77
00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:28.950
No worries.

78
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:31.560
I was trying to open the

79
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.470
phil.tully@adp.com: Meeting the

80
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.800
John Mertic: Oh, the agenda, do me to drop it in the chat with that help

81
00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.650
phil.tully@adp.com: I think that's easier because I'm

82
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:47.040
John Mertic: All right, I just dropped it in the chat. I apologize. A little bit down in the links.

83
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:48.450
phil.tully@adp.com: All right.

84
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:51.960
phil.tully@adp.com: So,

85
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.340
phil.tully@adp.com: I'm gonna I'll take this from here, but

86
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:03.030
phil.tully@adp.com: Guys healthy habits is, do we have any one on from advocacy.

87
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.120
Joe Bostian: Yes, this is Joe Boston i'm john and I talked a little bit

88
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.520
Joe Bostian: Before I asked about

89
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.790
Joe Bostian: Project in its direction.

90
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.280
phil.tully@adp.com: There weren't ready really any

91
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.030
Joe Bostian: Elements, so I don't really have a lot to report on that.

92
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.830
Joe Bostian: But we did meet and talk a little bit

93
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:24.360
Okay.

94
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:31.050
phil.tully@adp.com: Have you had any traction or movement at all. I mean,

95
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.230
Joe Bostian: So there are

96
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.910
Joe Bostian: There are

97
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:42.240
Joe Bostian: A few different places where. Excuse me. Sorry, we are using the website.

98
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.400
Joe Bostian: Website.

99
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.750
Joe Bostian: Using the project as a

100
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:57.810
Joe Bostian: Way to externalize some of the the assets that we've particularly been creating around container extensions and and Docker images. We're putting recipes out there and we're pointing to them and

101
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:05.940
Joe Bostian: In various locations to, you know, sort of help people get started with using Docker in a

102
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:22.890
Joe Bostian: You know, on IBM z in general just as some examples. And we're giving some how to advice out there. So, um, that seems to be, you know, going well in terms of serving as a resource for people to consult and

103
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.040
Joe Bostian: And start using as a reference.

104
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.210
Joe Bostian: So that side of it, we're, you know, we're pretty pleased with

105
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.700
Joe Bostian: There's, there's more work to do, you know, on some of the other

106
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:36.570
Joe Bostian: Some of the other

107
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:44.160
Joe Bostian: facets of this project that we're trying to move forward, but I don't really have anything to report on any of that yet.

108
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:45.510
Okay.

109
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.210
phil.tully@adp.com: Appreciate it. Sure.

110
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.920
phil.tully@adp.com: Anyone with the atom plugin.

111
00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:05.400
phil.tully@adp.com: Where we were as a team where we should be looking at discussing whether or not we want to redo this in the incubation status of this particular

112
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.530
phil.tully@adp.com: I think we may have to take it offline if no one's on

113
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.740
phil.tully@adp.com: How about a long

114
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.280
phil.tully@adp.com: Been active Hey Phil, it's Mike freezing

115
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:31.710
Mike Friesenegger: Yeah, I'll speak up. Hello. So we had a great project meeting last Thursday, and there are three things that I want to report from from the project meeting.

116
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.640
Mike Friesenegger: Two of them are presentation related

117
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.930
Mike Friesenegger: The first was, we have

118
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:44.280
Mike Friesenegger: An exciting on potential submission to the

119
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.290
Mike Friesenegger: Project by

120
00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.770
Mike Friesenegger: Around dynamic

121
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.620
Mike Friesenegger: Direct scuzzy assignments.

122
00:20:53.010 --> 00:21:08.880
Mike Friesenegger: To Z VM guests and it's it's actually being done by a partner, which is exciting. So the intern that was working on it went through explained it in a very short period of time, but I think it hit home.

123
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.880
Mike Friesenegger: To show the, the ability that have

124
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.070
Mike Friesenegger: Have and make it

125
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.010
Mike Friesenegger: Make it easy for people to see how they can contribute

126
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.630
Mike Friesenegger: To the project.

127
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.230
Mike Friesenegger: Which that led on to another discussion that

128
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.180
Mike Friesenegger: leads into there is a

129
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.340
Mike Friesenegger: summer intern mentorship program project that has been accepted, and I believe in in

130
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.610
Mike Friesenegger: an intern has already been

131
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.680
Mike Friesenegger: Selected for

132
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:38.700
Mike Friesenegger: That will be

133
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.560
Mike Friesenegger: answerable enabling

134
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.140
Mike Friesenegger: The RESTful API.

135
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:49.980
Mike Friesenegger: That is presented by the phone capability. So that was the first thing. The second thing is

136
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:51.840
Mike Friesenegger: The we

137
00:21:52.170 --> 00:22:00.210
Mike Friesenegger: Because this project came out of work from IBM IBM had their CI CD infrastructure internally.

138
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.510
Mike Friesenegger: We are still working to get the CI CD infrastructure.

139
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:10.980
Mike Friesenegger: Out into the into the community. So the Linux Foundation team.

140
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:16.380
Mike Friesenegger: presented a proposal for getting that CI CD infrastructure up and running.

141
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.410
Mike Friesenegger: We've looked at Jenkins. We're also

142
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:25.380
Mike Friesenegger: Looking at potentially using a GitHub actions technology for CI CD.

143
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.030
Mike Friesenegger: That's the second

144
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.940
Mike Friesenegger: And then the third arm is

145
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:34.980
Mike Friesenegger: For the developers that want to take advantage of and contribute to Fei long

146
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.090
phil.tully@adp.com: If they

147
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:42.030
Mike Friesenegger: If they want to do that and they want to test their code, they're going to need to be able to access Z VM environment.

148
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:49.710
Mike Friesenegger: A number of partners are interested in donating some of the resources.

149
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.970
Mike Friesenegger: And so we've got a

150
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.800
Mike Friesenegger: partner who is actually going to be donating second level VM access

151
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.230
Mike Friesenegger: To developers so they can develop

152
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:07.260
Mike Friesenegger: Test document. Once it's checked in, then hopefully the CI CD will do its job of continuous integration, continuous

153
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.740
Mike Friesenegger: Delivery and while we've got the full process in

154
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.920
Mike Friesenegger: Place to allow the Community to contribute.

155
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.290
Mike Friesenegger: And for us to validate and test the project.

156
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.390
Mike Friesenegger: For customer for people to use

157
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:20.820
phil.tully@adp.com: Which

158
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:22.500
phil.tully@adp.com: Partner

159
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.230
phil.tully@adp.com: Uncle Lenny.

160
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:27.030
Mike Friesenegger: Thank you, let him.

161
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.280
phil.tully@adp.com: Yes. Okay, I

162
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:31.890
phil.tully@adp.com: Can I can

163
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.200
18049181726: Get ok we have others that are

164
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.360
Mike Friesenegger: Interested, so I didn't

165
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:47.970
Mike Friesenegger: Thank you, Lynn for for speaking up we have other partners that are also interested, there is some things that need to happen in their environments before they can do that but but ultimately we're trying not to put

166
00:23:48.390 --> 00:24:00.960
Mike Friesenegger: All of the burden on land and and and and and his team. So I, I appreciate all of the involvement from everybody that's willing to step up and provide the access to resources.

167
00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:02.730
phil.tully@adp.com: Right, I

168
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.070
phil.tully@adp.com: Was wonderful having any apart is jumping in with resources and

169
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.030
phil.tully@adp.com: And definitely having glad as a person goes help

170
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.910
phil.tully@adp.com: But. Wonderful. Thank you. That's it. Thank you. Thank you very much.

171
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:29.280
18049181726: And Mike. Mike, you've done a great job bringing this to where it is today. So I just like to say that in front of everybody done a very nice job. Thanks. Lynn. Thank you.

172
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:35.700
phil.tully@adp.com: How about polish. Definitely. And if I mispronounced that I apologize.

173
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:37.650
18049181726: You get it. Phil

174
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.360
phil.tully@adp.com: Is Jerry. Yeah.

175
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.780
18049181726: All right, I'll give you a quick update on to fill this is Lana again.

176
00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:50.970
18049181726: Doing

177
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.000
18049181726: Pretty much the same things we're doing with

178
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.040
18049181726: phalanx long

179
00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.210
18049181726: We have we're working with Jerry Edgington

180
00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:04.470
18049181726: Getting it up and running.

181
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.650
18049181726: Quite a ways down the road with that with him on our system.

182
00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:16.620
18049181726: And just finalizing his

183
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:26.220
18049181726: VPN access and things like that so that he can do it from where he is working from home and

184
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:31.920
18049181726: We should be well underway. So for Gary to keep

185
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.280
18049181726: Advancing

186
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.650
18049181726: Jenkins. Okay.

187
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:40.290
phil.tully@adp.com: Okay.

188
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.190
phil.tully@adp.com: Appreciate that. Well,

189
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.780
phil.tully@adp.com: Here's just like the atom plugin the terse decompress status of you incubate status.

190
00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.690
phil.tully@adp.com: Challenges.

191
00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.830
phil.tully@adp.com: I know I have not reviewed it at all.

192
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:03.810
phil.tully@adp.com: Does anyone

193
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:05.760
phil.tully@adp.com: Discussing that

194
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.630
John Mertic: As far as far as I know, I think.

195
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.890
John Mertic: Both the item plugs in the touristy complex press Ingo had an action item to

196
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.650
John Mertic: Connect with the folks leading those projects.

197
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:17.610
phil.tully@adp.com: And I just, that's right.

198
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.050
John Mertic: It's falling through the cracks.

199
00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.890
phil.tully@adp.com: Probably fell to the being homebound

200
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.390
John Mertic: Yeah. That doesn't help.

201
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.260
phil.tully@adp.com: Believe me, it's thrown everyone all

202
00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:30.120
phil.tully@adp.com: Right. No.

203
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.160
18049181726: Okay, I'm not going to

204
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:37.800
phil.tully@adp.com: Push that button right now because again, there's too many things floating around for everybody.

205
00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:40.440
phil.tully@adp.com: About Zorro

206
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:44.640
For me, New York.

207
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:55.380
John Mertic: I don't see here and on the line and I don't I don't have an update from them. I haven't been on that I wasn't on the last call.

208
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.220
phil.tully@adp.com: Without the ACTIVE PROJECTS anyone from

209
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.140
phil.tully@adp.com: Ed.

210
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.670
John Mertic: You guys see James caffery on the line. I don't know. James, if you

211
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:12.780
John Mertic: Have any updates.

212
00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.240
John Mertic: You might be on mute, James.

213
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.400
James Caffrey: Is that better.

214
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:25.980
phil.tully@adp.com: Yeah.

215
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.670
James Caffrey: So we have a summer intern coming

216
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:50.370
James Caffrey: The project. He proposed is to extend at to look at things above the Linux kernel CES log and we'll get some of the things that are generated by things like and James UWS GI. So yeah, very excited about that. He's on

217
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.660
James Caffrey: I believe he's accepted and we're going to get started working on it.

218
00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.300
James Caffrey: Probably as soon as he's he's off since he's out of school.

219
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.580
phil.tully@adp.com: I can meet a lot of things nowadays. Thank you.

220
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:11.340
phil.tully@adp.com: People out of school that are at home in school, out of school break

221
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:13.320
phil.tully@adp.com: Thank you.

222
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:22.860
phil.tully@adp.com: I'm good job mentorship to go to go to Zoe first, just because I think Ben ships may have more conversation.

223
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:24.690
phil.tully@adp.com: How

224
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.750
phil.tully@adp.com: Are we doing. This is Sean

225
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:42.840
Sean Grady: Sean Grady from this group. And I guess how I can cover it this week is that we were recently doing a p i, planning, where all the groups came together and we're talking about what they want to do for the next few months.

226
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:51.900
Sean Grady: We're not quite finished, we had to reschedule. Some of it, but the highlights that I'm seeing from the groups that did report so far are that

227
00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:03.300
Sean Grady: It seems like a common theme across the squad's is to try to completion, our single sign on efforts that are based on a loss and Jay WT

228
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:08.430
Sean Grady: Every single component of so he will be a participant in that

229
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.840
Sean Grady: And that's, that's probably, you know, within a month or two.

230
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:16.830
Sean Grady: Other things that we're looking into are

231
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:38.850
Sean Grady: enhancing our security model by allowing for our HTTPS and pls credentials to be stored in soft key rings as opposed to today, in which some things are stored in encrypted Unix files. So giving more choice to the users that way.

232
00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.930
Sean Grady: I'm also seeing that

233
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:49.530
Sean Grady: Zoe seelye side, there has been some work to try and define

234
00:29:51.120 --> 00:30:01.620
Sean Grady: The different segments of the code base a little bit better and and try to organize around ways in which we can engage the end users. So

235
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:23.460
Sean Grady: One. One thing that comes to mind is that there is the Zoe explorer for Visual Studio code and they are looking to reorganize in terms of how they conduct, you know, their, their meetings and such to better distinguished from the COI goals and

236
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:35.640
Sean Grady: On the framework side of things. They are looking to branch out so that their framework. Not only has the existing Node JS flavor but will also have a Python flavor and

237
00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:42.960
Sean Grady: People are getting interested in exploring what that actually means and what are the differences and how they can work together.

238
00:30:44.940 --> 00:31:09.000
Sean Grady: The last group is the web UI group. And there again. So, so is a theme. But there are other themes such as doing a redesign of the desktop to give people more customization options, you know, maximize screen real estate or or make it make the elements bigger for accessibility.

239
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:10.830
Sean Grady: But

240
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:16.920
Sean Grady: We're also looking a little bit farther ahead on to new themes which is

241
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:27.870
Sean Grady: Can we leverage containers or Docker so that there are more than one way to get so we set up, depending on your preference. Right now we're

242
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:43.200
Sean Grady: All on the iOS for our servers. Some of the clients can run Windows, but all the servers are on the iOS. So we're starting to think about, well, can we package our servers in ways that allow you to run them on the Linux or some other place.

243
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:45.390
Sean Grady: As an option.

244
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:57.600
Sean Grady: The other thing that we're very early on looking into is how can we enhance him better document our high availability story.

245
00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:13.290
Sean Grady: So if people have any experience in high availability specifically on the CLS side, we would be interested to learn and hear any suggestions that you might have. Because it's still kind of early on for us in that topic.

246
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.880
Sean Grady: I think that covers everything. Yeah.

247
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.210
Okay, that's great. Um,

248
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.430
phil.tully@adp.com: When do you

249
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.990
phil.tully@adp.com: When do you expect to have your kind of your goals put out

250
00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:36.120
Sean Grady: So, some of them are already listed on the GitHub that I'll link in chat right here.

251
00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.550
phil.tully@adp.com: We are planning to meet

252
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:45.600
Sean Grady: again next week to finish the meeting that got rescheduled so there will be more on that page at that time.

253
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:48.000
Sean Grady: Great, thank you.

254
00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:49.140
Yep.

255
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.380
Sean Grady: Now, I think we can move back to

256
00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.560
phil.tully@adp.com: Mentorship so much. Anyone have questions about Zoe.

257
00:32:59.100 --> 00:32:59.400
phil.tully@adp.com: Okay.

258
00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.750
Bob Dahlberg: This is about Ahlberg we've

259
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.540
Bob Dahlberg: sent letters out to mentees

260
00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:07.380
phil.tully@adp.com: And

261
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:08.220
We had

262
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.920
Bob Dahlberg: What we had

263
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.440
Bob Dahlberg: Eight slots, but we've got 11

264
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:17.340
Bob Dahlberg: mentees that we want. I think we submitted.

265
00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.260
Bob Dahlberg: 10 offers already

266
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.390
18049181726: And I think

267
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.220
Bob Dahlberg: We're about to send out the 11th, which leaves. So a shortfall. We can discuss the head

268
00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:34.350
Bob Dahlberg: Of the projects we have five Zoe projects for from rocket

269
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:37.020
Bob Dahlberg: In one from Viacom infinity.

270
00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.870
Bob Dahlberg: Who's going to be mandatory. We got Z inspect

271
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:42.570
Bob Dahlberg: We've got an

272
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.410
Ad

273
00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:45.720
phil.tully@adp.com: Enable

274
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.150
Bob Dahlberg: IBM z in

275
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.650
Bob Dahlberg: Ml model scope.

276
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:50.790
Bob Dahlberg: We got

277
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.450
Bob Dahlberg: Enhance Z VM Proteus.

278
00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:55.290
phil.tully@adp.com: exporter.

279
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:57.780
Bob Dahlberg: We got a fail on answerable module.

280
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.180
Bob Dahlberg: And we've got a cube CF

281
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.630
Bob Dahlberg: So those are the 11 projects that were chosen

282
00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:15.810
Bob Dahlberg: We've got a diversity. Again, we've got a lot of mentees from India. We've got a few from the US. And we've got one from Nigeria.

283
00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:21.600
Bob Dahlberg: So, given the fact that we had eight in the budget.

284
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:22.800
Bob Dahlberg: We had

285
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.370
Bob Dahlberg: 64,000 budgeted for the

286
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.800
Bob Dahlberg: Mentors

287
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.510
Bob Dahlberg: But with eight with travel

288
00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:36.360
Bob Dahlberg: That leaves us, that would be 88,000 that leaves us a 24,000 shortfall.

289
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:42.000
Bob Dahlberg: And that includes the $6,000 stipend, plus the $2,000 travel to

290
00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.520
Bob Dahlberg: Double so

291
00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:46.770
Bob Dahlberg: One, we could see if we can

292
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.280
Bob Dahlberg: Squeeze out of the budget, the extra 24,000 somewhere.

293
00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:52.650
Bob Dahlberg: Or what we could do.

294
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.840
Bob Dahlberg: Is we could remove the travel

295
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.330
Bob Dahlberg: And have the students do

296
00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:09.360
Bob Dahlberg: You know, kind of a real time presentation, along with a kind of a video of their presentation so we could use it throughout the year as a marketing tool.

297
00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:10.470
Bob Dahlberg: That would

298
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:24.570
Bob Dahlberg: Leave us only with a $6,000 shortfall. So I think a lot determines in terms of what we we go will depend upon where we if the money can be squeezed out of the budget, but also which way with

299
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.430
Bob Dahlberg: Maybe there might be a preference to

300
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.680
phil.tully@adp.com: What you're given.

301
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.580
Peter Fandel: Pretty much, there will be a lot of traveling going on. I was

302
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:34.830
phil.tully@adp.com: I was about to say the same exact thing.

303
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.830
phil.tully@adp.com: Well, that that could be true.

304
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.840
Bob Dahlberg: But they made you know

305
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:48.120
Bob Dahlberg: You know, the government has said that by false, you know, university should be open again and the

306
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.610
Bob Dahlberg: Dublin conferences in October.

307
00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.990
phil.tully@adp.com: Dublin conferences still scheduled for October. Correct.

308
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.950
phil.tully@adp.com: The challenge is

309
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:21.060
phil.tully@adp.com: I know some conferences through June have been just been canceled. I don't know. I think there's enough question marks up in the air that I'd rather hold say let's not push ourselves expect travel

310
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:38.370
phil.tully@adp.com: Yep, and it would in a, in a way, it would give us the advantage to see if this is, this works without traveling to doing presentations and see what the value point is there. It might even be more valuable to have something that we can carry forward as a information.

311
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:42.030
Bob Dahlberg: Yeah, you're thinking the same way I am, because you know

312
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:52.950
Bob Dahlberg: The travel is a nice perk for the students. But realistically, they're traveling all that way for probably what a 1015 minute presentation at the conference.

313
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.170
Bob Dahlberg: I think we could do that remotely. But then if we have them do

314
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:04.500
Bob Dahlberg: A video presentation also

315
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:11.550
Bob Dahlberg: We could use that and post that up on our website. So that gives them longer exposure and more exposure. So I think

316
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.930
Bob Dahlberg: You're right, we have to look at the cost benefit sending most of these

317
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.030
Bob Dahlberg: Students halfway around the world.

318
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.830
phil.tully@adp.com: I know I agree. And quite frankly,

319
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:29.010
phil.tully@adp.com: Use the current situation to our benefit to find out if this is a better way of going

320
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:30.210
phil.tully@adp.com: Yeah, no.

321
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:30.600
phil.tully@adp.com: No.

322
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.600
Bob Dahlberg: Am I feeling is, I would much rather give

323
00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:40.200
Bob Dahlberg: more opportunity to more students, then you know offer a few student, you know, the eight

324
00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:42.180
Bob Dahlberg: A travel perk.

325
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.260
phil.tully@adp.com: I, I agree.

326
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.110
phil.tully@adp.com: With the comment from the rest of the

327
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:50.430
phil.tully@adp.com: Day.

328
00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.110
phil.tully@adp.com: Or whatever, where

329
00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.680
phil.tully@adp.com: Do we, do we want to take a vote.

330
00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.220
Bob Dahlberg: On this

331
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.000
Bob Dahlberg: A verbal vote.

332
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:06.300
phil.tully@adp.com: Do we have a quorum. JOHN I you actually do you have

333
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:08.610
John Mertic: Every single voting tax number here.

334
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:10.620
John Mertic: Right, this shit down

335
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.030
phil.tully@adp.com: Yeah, okay.

336
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:16.290
John Mertic: So yeah, I mean, that's sort of the recommendation.

337
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:22.260
Bob Dahlberg: Let me, let me put out the you know the emotion. Emotion that we

338
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:24.720
Bob Dahlberg: Not do the travel

339
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:35.400
Bob Dahlberg: This year, and instead do a live maybe presentation through video chat and can presentations for for use

340
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:42.690
Bob Dahlberg: In marketing and use the money instead to finance more students in the program.

341
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:45.540
John Mertic: Maybe when a second

342
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.370
phil.tully@adp.com: I second that.

343
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:52.110
John Mertic: Okay Phil, and I see Peter literally did it in chat at the same time. So we'll give you

344
00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.450
John Mertic: I'll give you a split hair, they're

345
00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:55.920
John Mertic: Voting

346
00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.840
John Mertic: For the voting members. I'm all in favor. Aye.

347
00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:02.550
James Caffrey: Aye. Aye.

348
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:06.660
Peter Fandel: Aye. Aye. Any opposed by hand.

349
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:07.650
John Mertic: Yeah.

350
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.810
John Mertic: We are any poser abstain from that.

351
00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:20.430
John Mertic: Okay. Motion carried. So I will update the feel I can work out there if you want to chime in on the governing board discussion with where the attack is with this.

352
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.380
Peter Fandel: We can get this moving

353
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:23.790
Peter Fandel: Yeah.

354
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.530
John Mertic: Okay, okay. I know.

355
00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:26.610
phil.tully@adp.com: I'll bring it up to

356
00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:28.740
phil.tully@adp.com: Run it by Steve.

357
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.570
phil.tully@adp.com: If I can get a hold of them use also, of course, you're at home.

358
00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:40.620
phil.tully@adp.com: And yeah, it makes me it makes a lot more sense. Yeah.

359
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:49.710
Bob Dahlberg: So that means that we would only have to ask for $6,000 more as opposed to 24,000. So we've got to ask for

360
00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.810
Bob Dahlberg: An additional $6,000 in funding.

361
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:53.520
Bob Dahlberg: Right.

362
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:54.360
Okay.

363
00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.140
phil.tully@adp.com: Okay.

364
00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.040
phil.tully@adp.com: Thank you, that was it was good.

365
00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:03.360
phil.tully@adp.com: Club.

366
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:10.800
phil.tully@adp.com: And I know it's out there and I it's me trying to find anything lately.

367
00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:15.030
phil.tully@adp.com: The list of projects that are

368
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:19.560
phil.tully@adp.com: Flowing it's out on the GitHub. Correct.

369
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.780
John Mertic: Yeah yeah

370
00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:27.330
John Mertic: Yeah, I think there's a couple. So there's a two here that we're going to present today.

371
00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.080
John Mertic: That had proposals ready and I put links.

372
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:37.140
John Mertic: At least into GitHub and they think they're all posted there. One of them is a pull request. One is from as a PDF

373
00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:47.010
John Mertic: And I know the first one in there is just some zoom meeting guidelines that I put that out there as a pull request. I don't know folks had a chance to review those are not

374
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:57.240
John Mertic: A little bit of the background here is that we're starting to see more increasing bombing. Happy New meetings. So putting some guidelines together.

375
00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:05.250
John Mertic: For just managing them in a secure way we thought was helpful, but then also the other half of just good guidance on running meetings.

376
00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:17.880
John Mertic: I'm not gonna lie. So a lot of this stuff from CNC F because they do a really good job at these things and they've really led the way here, but I don't know if anybody's had a chance to look at it. Any questions, concerns.

377
00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:20.340
Peter Fandel: I

378
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.290
phil.tully@adp.com: Have not okay.

379
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:34.890
John Mertic: Maybe if it's already members that he's going to take a look at that and then maybe we can do a vote to, you know, except in that pull request, we can do that in the background of that. Does that make sense.

380
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:36.960
phil.tully@adp.com: Yeah, it probably does.

381
00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:42.990
phil.tully@adp.com: I know I just didn't have. I just didn't get attraction. I saw all the email looks like.

382
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:49.440
John Mertic: You and me both. Yeah. No, it's, it's totally understandable, um,

383
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:49.800
phil.tully@adp.com: Okay.

384
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.430
John Mertic: Do we want to kick into the cobalt course project proposal.

385
00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.950
phil.tully@adp.com: Yeah. All right.

386
00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.380
John Mertic: I'm going to do attempt

387
00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:03.750
John Mertic: I think

388
00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.570
John Mertic: I have made you presenter. I don't know if that's

389
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:09.360
John Mertic: That worked.

390
00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.180
John Mertic: Yeah, if you have anything to share or not.

391
00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:15.300
Peter Fandel: Yes, thank you john

392
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:19.620
Sudharsana Srinivasan: I was just going to bring up the document that we that I had already

393
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:21.570
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Shared with

394
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.030
Sudharsana Srinivasan: You the proposal.

395
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.960
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Okay. Not sure. That's good.

396
00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.070
Okay.

397
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.620
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Sharing is not working. I'm going to have to quit zoom to give

398
00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:45.630
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Catalina permission to

399
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.180
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Let me share my screen. Sorry about that.

400
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:59.790
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Okay, so for the cobalt course, we've been working on this, since the beginning of March and creating a new cobalt

401
00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.770
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Content that

402
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.100
phil.tully@adp.com: Would

403
00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:03.720
Sudharsana Srinivasan: That is also at the heart.

404
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.150
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Focusing on bringing in

405
00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:06.960
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Some of the

406
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:09.300
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Modern tools that

407
00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:13.170
Sudharsana Srinivasan: You know, would be more engaging and bring a

408
00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.870
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Modern interface to how we interact with

409
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:19.230
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Golf Ball. So at the core. This is a cobalt

410
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.820
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Force for beginners.

411
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:24.090
Sudharsana Srinivasan: With use of VS Code.

412
00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.170
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Has no II.

413
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.510
Sudharsana Srinivasan: And z open editor as the tooling.

414
00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.950
Sudharsana Srinivasan: THANK YOU, JOHN for sharing that.

415
00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:29.880
Course

416
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:43.470
Sudharsana Srinivasan: So we've been working on this and smart, as I've said in this document here and we are ready with the content at least the first draft of it to be able to share

417
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.810
phil.tully@adp.com: In the project here.

418
00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:52.950
Sudharsana Srinivasan: And have it as an open source document available. So this project was something we worked on in collaboration

419
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.220
Sudharsana Srinivasan: I'd like to point out with the State of California and

420
00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:58.500
Sudharsana Srinivasan: American River College. So what

421
00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.260
Sudharsana Srinivasan: What that does is makes this

422
00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:02.610
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Public domain.

423
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:04.350
Sudharsana Srinivasan: available to anyone.

424
00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.110
Sudharsana Srinivasan: at no cost. So

425
00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:09.270
Sudharsana Srinivasan: That's what I would

426
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.050
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Like to add

427
00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:10.680
As well.

428
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:15.030
Peter Fandel: You

429
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:17.340
Gregory MacKinnon: Can ask the question, does this is

430
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:18.390
Gregory MacKinnon: Greg McKinnon

431
00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.100
Gregory MacKinnon: Can you hear me.

432
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:21.330
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Yeah yeah

433
00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.280
phil.tully@adp.com: Okay. Okay, thanks. I, uh,

434
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:27.750
Gregory MacKinnon: I was just wondering, I mean it sounds really cool. In terms of, you know, providing a

435
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:37.590
Gregory MacKinnon: Modern experience for Co bomb. I think that's, that's something that sounds great. And I just wondering though, you mentioned zero NZ open editor i mean i was i guess i

436
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:55.680
Gregory MacKinnon: Are all are all the things you're looking to bring to bear on this, you know, purely open source. I mean like you know the the VS Code explorer stuff and from Zoe, and unlike, say Schaefer z which is an eclipse open source thing that provides cobalt experiences as well. I mean, those things.

437
00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.750
Gregory MacKinnon: Are purely open source. I'm wondering is,

438
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.870
Gregory MacKinnon: Is the open editor, like a purely open source thing.

439
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.470
Gregory MacKinnon: Because we should be vendor neutral in that regard. Here, said my

440
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:11.370
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Good question. I am

441
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:18.960
Sudharsana Srinivasan: I'm not sure I have the answer to. If the open editors truly an open source thing.

442
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.810
Sudharsana Srinivasan: Anybody else on this.

443
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.040
John Mertic: I guess maybe

444
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:24.870
Joe Devlin: It is, isn't

445
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:28.470
John Mertic: Okay, I got to look I don't know off the top of my head.

446
00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:29.700
Joe Devlin: What's on Grady, please.

447
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:30.270
Joe Devlin: Pipe up

448
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:33.690
Joe Devlin: Mr.

449
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:35.430
Peter Fandel: I'm not

450
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.810
Sean Grady: Part of Philly itself. It's hot it you're open source that was

451
00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:41.040
Joe Devlin: Greg's question, I believe.

452
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.800
Sean Grady: Yeah I don't actually know the answer.

453
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.460
Gregory MacKinnon: I'm not trying to be

454
00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:48.420
Gregory MacKinnon: You know, probably, you know,

455
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.730
Gregory MacKinnon: Difficult. I was just curious though because it's

456
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:52.410
Joe Devlin: With us

457
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:56.130
Gregory MacKinnon: I would guess. We want to be vendor neutral if you know if anything

458
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.580
Sean Grady: I think so. I think theater Homer would know the answer. Yeah.

459
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:09.390
phil.tully@adp.com: Yeah, but I think this is this is the class in in in baseline coble with and the class itself and teaching coble's

460
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.930
phil.tully@adp.com: Is going to be

461
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:15.030
phil.tully@adp.com: Open

462
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:16.620
Sean Grady: And

463
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.200
Sean Grady: Available frequent

464
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.950
Sean Grady: Yeah, I actually see it.

465
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:27.420
Sean Grady: I see it on GitHub.

466
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.600
Sean Grady: At least part of it. I'm going to see if there's more to it.

467
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:38.820
Gregory MacKinnon: Yeah, yeah. I appreciate that. Sean, I mean I, it may will be purely open source but I might see some reason I have this nagging

468
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.590
Gregory MacKinnon: Belief. I don't know.

469
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:46.560
Gregory MacKinnon: Maybe I'm wrong, but it is not entirely open source. I'm just just curious.

470
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.300
phil.tully@adp.com: Okay, yeah, I'll

471
00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:51.060
Sean Grady: Let you know what I find out. Okay. Thanks, Sean by

472
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.520
Joe Devlin: Chris dragon. I think the specific question would be,

473
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.540
Joe Devlin: Not that the front end or the first layer of connection is open.

474
00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:05.760
Joe Devlin: But somewhere as as the MSP and DAP implementations go they connect to a proprietary thing somewhere in the back end.

475
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:06.570
Joe Devlin: That would be my

476
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.430
Joe Devlin: Guess if there were a weakness.

477
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:13.230
Gregory MacKinnon: So yeah, dude. Is it actually run the cool ballers or just an editor.

478
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.480
Bob Dahlberg: For source code.

479
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.400
Joe Devlin: Editor that needs a

480
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:20.850
Joe Devlin: Backing environment behind that that provides the language.

481
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:23.220
Joe Devlin: Implementation on the debugger implementation.

482
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.760
Bob Dahlberg: Okay, okay. It's an ID kind of thing that yeah

483
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:27.780
Joe Devlin: Through open protocols.

484
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:42.540
John Mertic: Yeah, so, so just just just to understand is, is the z open editor, like a hard dependency of this coursework, or is it just one of the optional things that one could use the course work with. I guess I'm

485
00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.910
John Mertic: Not entirely sure where that stands

486
00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.550
Martin Keen: Yes, so this is Martin.

487
00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:49.650
Martin Keen: And Martin keno working with the data on this.

488
00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:52.860
Martin Keen: Project. So we are using

489
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:55.380
Martin Keen: VS Code zero and editor and Zoe.

490
00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:57.420
Martin Keen: To illustrate how to

491
00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.200
Martin Keen: Program.

492
00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:59.700
Martin Keen: In Cobo what is not

493
00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.300
Martin Keen: A requirement. And in fact, at the end of the book we provide

494
00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:14.400
Martin Keen: Some other alternatives for working with Kobo instead. So IBM developer for z is another example that again and then just plain old I SPF as well. So we illustrate all of our

495
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:19.230
Martin Keen: Examples using the Zinio meditator ID, but it is not a requirement for anybody.

496
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:20.700
Martin Keen: Following along

497
00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.320
phil.tully@adp.com: In the lab exercises.

498
00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:23.280
Martin Keen: To use it as well.

499
00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:32.580
Gregory MacKinnon: Interesting. Yeah, I guess, I guess, besides Asking about G open editor be. I was just, it seems like it'd be a good opportunity to

500
00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:44.400
Gregory MacKinnon: To, you know, if you want to put a monetization, YOU KNOW, EXPERIENCE. On top of this, you know, the BS to exploit VS code and stuff. The explorers seem natural sounds like that may already be

501
00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:45.330
phil.tully@adp.com: In play

502
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:49.320
Gregory MacKinnon: But there's also, as I mentioned, the Shea frizzy stuff, which is an open source.

503
00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:58.950
Gregory MacKinnon: Way to interact with co ball is as well. So I just wanted to put those on the table and as things to consider. And also, I would be curious if

504
00:48:59.070 --> 00:48:59.490
Gregory MacKinnon: You know,

505
00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:04.860
Gregory MacKinnon: Whenever you find out Sean around GOP I'd appreciate

506
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.110
Gregory MacKinnon: Understanding that a little better. Thank you.

507
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:18.720
Sean Grady: Yeah, as far as I'm seeing on their website, it appears to be a Visual Studio Code extension based on them. So we see a lie. But I don't know like

508
00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:26.580
Sean Grady: Besides their pre wrecking of Zoe. If the stuff on top is open source and trying to find

509
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:28.770
Sean Grady: Any mention of that.

510
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:31.230
Gregory MacKinnon: Okay, thank you, Sean. Appreciate it.

511
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:32.610
Gregory MacKinnon: Thanks john

512
00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:37.560
John Mertic: Yeah, I put it, I put a link in the chat is that I think that's the eclipse che plugin that you were referencing

513
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.660
Gregory MacKinnon: A

514
00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:40.740
John Mertic: Che for z.

515
00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:44.310
Gregory MacKinnon: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, looks right.

516
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:44.640
Yeah.

517
00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:47.430
Gregory MacKinnon: You have to look at it and see that looks fine.

518
00:49:47.730 --> 00:50:03.030
John Mertic: So I guess just trying to understand from, from your perspective, are you seeing that is would you consider that as sort of a something that could be resolved in incubation, or would you want that corrected before the project would enter incubation.

519
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:06.750
Gregory MacKinnon: Are you dressing that to me.

520
00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:08.790
John Mertic: Yeah, you brought it up so

521
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:17.790
Gregory MacKinnon: I say yeah well well III don't know I it's a fair question. I'd have to think about it. I'm not, I'm not sure. I guess I just wanted to, you know,

522
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:28.230
Gregory MacKinnon: suggest some things that are really just, you know, open source and was sort of, you know, that seems like a good thing and just, you know, but as

523
00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:32.850
Gregory MacKinnon: I just think it's silly things that are open source can be brought into play here. I think that would be

524
00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:34.980
Gregory MacKinnon: You know, good thing and so I'm not sure.

525
00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:37.590
Gregory MacKinnon: What point. Things like that are resolved, but

526
00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:39.000
Gregory MacKinnon: You know, I just

527
00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:39.690
Gregory MacKinnon: You know, wanted to

528
00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:40.410
Gregory MacKinnon: Put it out there.

529
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:50.850
Bob Dahlberg: I've been teaching Python and other court in Java classes at the university level and I'm finding that you know I'm looking at the

530
00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:59.130
Bob Dahlberg: Z open editor and it runs on a Mac and Windows and I'm finding that students are running are buying these Chromebooks now.

531
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:07.020
Bob Dahlberg: That they have trouble installing with Mac or Windows thing. So, you almost need a web version.

532
00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:07.950
Gregory MacKinnon: Mm hmm.

533
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:12.330
Bob Dahlberg: So that that might be something to consider. Because a lot more students are more

534
00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:19.140
Bob Dahlberg: I'm at a university that has a lot of people that have never had any one in their family go to school and

535
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.090
Bob Dahlberg: You know, they're low income so

536
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:23.370
Bob Dahlberg: You know the Chromebooks become

537
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.810
Bob Dahlberg: A

538
00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.160
phil.tully@adp.com: More viable tool.

539
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.660
Bob Dahlberg: And a lot of the students

540
00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.730
Bob Dahlberg: Before they come don't realize that, you know,

541
00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.800
Bob Dahlberg: Gee, I got a Chromebook. I can't install this stuff.

542
00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.460
Bob Dahlberg: On the computer.

543
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:36.300
Gregory MacKinnon: Right. Well, that's where shape receipt could be useful, because that is a web

544
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.270
Gregory MacKinnon: You know, web ID experience, you know,

545
00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:40.320
Bob Dahlberg: So yeah, okay.

546
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:47.280
phil.tully@adp.com: Yeah, so, so I think I think from a project point of view, I wouldn't want to put that as a direct

547
00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:58.230
phil.tully@adp.com: It as they said it's already saying it's not it's not a mandatory item. I think what we want to make sure resenting is that there is availability to use an open source.

548
00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:11.490
phil.tully@adp.com: Tool as the front end. Let's and let's as part of the incubation process. Let's look to see what the actual tooling licensing is on the, the one that they're presenting

549
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:19.920
Mike Friesenegger: I think this. This is my presented. Right. I think it would be good at least to mention the tooling.

550
00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.810
Mike Friesenegger: And and that that

551
00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.040
Mike Friesenegger: The, the, so the

552
00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:24.720
Mike Friesenegger: Reader of this

553
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:30.780
Mike Friesenegger: Document could could could look at the tooling if they're not familiar with it and they could do a little bit of research themselves.

554
00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:32.520
Mike Friesenegger: Because there are there are

555
00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:37.290
Mike Friesenegger: Options available and like there was a

556
00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:40.560
Mike Friesenegger: In Linux. There's a tool called open cobalt. I think it's

557
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.660
Mike Friesenegger: been changed to the new Kobo

558
00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:46.770
Mike Friesenegger: So that's the back end compiler semantics and all that kind of stuff.

559
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:47.910
Mike Friesenegger: That's another option.

560
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.510
Mike Friesenegger: Yeah.

561
00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:53.310
Bob Dahlberg: I think that's a great idea, let it, let the professor instructor make a decision of

562
00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.540
Bob Dahlberg: How they're going to teach it.

563
00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:01.500
Bob Dahlberg: Because they know the audience better than we do. But I think is really good to give them options.

564
00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:05.010
John Mertic: If just, I guess.

565
00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:07.770
John Mertic: From the just understand from the project perspective.

566
00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.190
John Mertic: Is is the materials in such a way that it's

567
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:13.230
John Mertic: Easy to sort of de

568
00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.640
John Mertic: De couple that

569
00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:16.380
18049181726: Yeah, the

570
00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:20.070
Martin Keen: Material is all decoupled from that. So we have some screenshots.

571
00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:33.300
Martin Keen: Which show couple source code in the net and get to pick something so so we pick that but we provide all of the source code as part of this book and you can import it and edit it in

572
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.710
Martin Keen: The editor of your choosing. So

573
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:35.670
Martin Keen: Yeah.

574
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:37.290
phil.tully@adp.com: You could definitely assist with something else.

575
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:38.850
phil.tully@adp.com: Because

576
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:47.850
phil.tully@adp.com: It gives you the opportunity to be fully open source then. So which which makes sense.

577
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:50.940
It does.

578
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:53.520
phil.tully@adp.com: Okay.

579
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:59.130
phil.tully@adp.com: Now what john I'd be honest. What's the next step in terms of

580
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.640
phil.tully@adp.com: Moving with this project. It sounds great.

581
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.410
phil.tully@adp.com: Just as a sideline. It was with all the things going on.

582
00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:21.510
phil.tully@adp.com: I live in New Jersey and the governor of New Jersey on a daily basis talks about the current status and last week, he announced that the state of New Jersey was looking for multiple Kobo programmers.

583
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:30.210
phil.tully@adp.com: To help them code there. Some of the software that to manage what's happening in the state. I was, I almost fell off my chair.

584
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.500
phil.tully@adp.com: Unfortunately, he's asking for

585
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.930
Mark Post: Volunteers, not people won't want

586
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:37.740
phil.tully@adp.com: I know I

587
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:44.670
phil.tully@adp.com: I was not directly listening. I just heard your cocoa coming out of the governor's mouth. I was like,

588
00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:49.380
phil.tully@adp.com: No Keke

589
00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:50.190
Mark Post: Keke Keke Keke Wyatt a

590
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:51.630
Mark Post: Topic on Twitter.

591
00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:53.400
John Mertic: Oh, I

592
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.190
John Mertic: I don't watch Twitter.

593
00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:03.240
phil.tully@adp.com: I don't even listen to that somebody else had it on in the house. And I was like, What the hell's going on there.

594
00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:09.390
Bob Dahlberg: So as we mature this. Do we want to provide say of a certification or something. We give a

595
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:13.440
Bob Dahlberg: You know, we can identify a certain level of expertise.

596
00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:16.710
18049181726: Interview.

597
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.120
Bob Dahlberg: We entertain later.

598
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:19.710
It's not a

599
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:21.900
Bob Dahlberg: Bad. Yeah, there we go.

600
00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:26.280
John Mertic: Yeah i mean i think i think there's been some discussions on the early on part of

601
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:34.320
John Mertic: If we, you know, incorporate this into some of the online trading platforms. I think there's an immediate plan for Coursera and I think there's some discussions of

602
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:41.910
John Mertic: Leveraging the Linux Foundation's training arm and pushing this through edX that that could be an opportunity that emerges itself.

603
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.040
John Mertic: You know, fairly, you know,

604
00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:53.730
Bob Dahlberg: I've been working with the Virginia cyber security range which is we provide content for education, for security.

605
00:55:54.360 --> 00:56:02.580
Bob Dahlberg: And you know, we want to get. We wanted to offer certifications. But what we did is we decided we're going to go to NIST because they've got the

606
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:18.480
Bob Dahlberg: List the nice program where they've listed the opportunity, job opportunities and we're going to try to get them to start sponsoring certification criteria so that it's more national than just state oriented, so

607
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:24.210
Bob Dahlberg: If this is open source. We may want to concern can consider something like that because

608
00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:25.830
Bob Dahlberg: If we offer a badge.

609
00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:27.240
Bob Dahlberg: We're tied to IBM again.

610
00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:34.230
John Mertic: Yeah, well, that we can issue better, but I guess I want to kind of get to Phils thing because I know we're kind of running short on time.

611
00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:40.500
John Mertic: But I think this is a great area for you to engage you know for anybody who's interested in grades directly in this project.

612
00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:44.790
John Mertic: I think Phil to your question. We have a quorum.

613
00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:51.150
John Mertic: If the tack is in a position that it would be willing to approve this as an incubator project.

614
00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:54.180
John Mertic: That's emotion. We could entertain at this point.

615
00:56:55.710 --> 00:57:03.300
phil.tully@adp.com: I see no reason why not. If there. I mean, we have questions, but every project we have, we would start with has questions so

616
00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:07.500
John Mertic: If anyone wants to do that.

617
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.880
18049181726: I'll second that.

618
00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:17.280
Bob Dahlberg: It was a maintenance was the most move this project into incubation status. All right. I'll second it.

619
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:20.730
John Mertic: I'm all in favor eyes.

620
00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:21.930
I

621
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:30.480
John Mertic: Assume there might be some people know, is there any opposers stain.

622
00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:37.350
John Mertic: Alright, so we

623
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:38.760
John Mertic: Have it in

624
00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:40.470
phil.tully@adp.com: Okay, wonderful.

625
00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:42.270
phil.tully@adp.com: Thank you.

626
00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:49.350
John Mertic: Thank you. Thank you. Um, and I guess now the next project is from Elizabeth Joseph

627
00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:54.480
John Mertic: Elizabeth I, can I think I tried to give you presenter. I don't know if

628
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:56.130
Elizabeth Joseph: I can, I can tell you right now.

629
00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:57.780
Elizabeth Joseph: I'm not going to be able to share my screen.

630
00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:03.060
Elizabeth Joseph: It's just, it's really just the application, though, if you could bring it up that would

631
00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:03.630
18049181726: Be Awesome.

632
00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:11.490
John Mertic: Okay, let me. I'm going to try to do that real quick here in the background, you can go ahead and start talking, if you want. Well, I tried to finagle this

633
00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:19.140
Elizabeth Joseph: Right. So this is a proposal for just a code search for finding software on z.

634
00:58:19.590 --> 00:58:20.250
Elizabeth Joseph: Because we're

635
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:28.350
Elizabeth Joseph: We currently have one that IBM maintains it's open source, and it searches. All of the Linux operating system.

636
00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:30.810
Elizabeth Joseph: Packages to see what's available.

637
00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:33.360
Elizabeth Joseph: But we want to expand that.

638
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:38.220
Elizabeth Joseph: And we thought that it might be a good place inside the open mainframe project to do that expansion.

639
00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:45.900
Elizabeth Joseph: So we want to start you know go beyond Linux distributions and also start searching possibly source code on GitHub or

640
00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:47.160
Elizabeth Joseph: You know, just the ideas are

641
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:50.430
Elizabeth Joseph: kind of up in the air right now, but we want to

642
00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:53.490
phil.tully@adp.com: Find a consolidated place for people to find first

643
00:58:53.760 --> 00:59:02.220
Elizabeth Joseph: software that's been ported to Linux on z. And then probably expand that to the iOS side as well so people can find software across the ecosystem.

644
00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:09.300
Elizabeth Joseph: Right. So this is the proposal want to bring up the file itself.

645
00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.330
John Mertic: Oh, heavens, I'm so sorry doing two things in the background there.

646
00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:15.600
Elizabeth Joseph: Yeah, there we go.

647
00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:18.360
phil.tully@adp.com: So the name

648
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:23.880
Elizabeth Joseph: needs to be fixed IBM Z software searches. Not a good name and you suggested

649
00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:32.820
Elizabeth Joseph: Like open source discovery tool, but I noticed that open mainframe projects have names that are not necessarily describing what the project.

650
00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:33.600
Elizabeth Joseph: Is so

651
00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:35.490
Elizabeth Joseph: I totally

652
00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:36.930
Elizabeth Joseph: Need help with the name

653
00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:37.380
But

654
00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:39.570
Elizabeth Joseph: Aside from that,

655
00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:43.230
Elizabeth Joseph: This is what's in the proposal.

656
00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:50.670
Elizabeth Joseph: If you want me to go over any more of it or if you have questions or

657
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:53.880
Mike Friesenegger: So, uh,

658
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:57.270
Mike Friesenegger: Hi, Liz. This is my present your pen.

659
00:59:57.330 --> 01:00:03.270
Mike Friesenegger: And I'm with Sue, so I'm gonna, I'm going to throw that out but so when I saw this, I

660
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:04.590
phil.tully@adp.com: looked at it and

661
01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:05.580
Mike Friesenegger: It seemed

662
01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:16.770
Mike Friesenegger: I looked at the code, very quickly, but it seems like somebody has to do dumps, you have to go out and do manual work to build the files that are that are read

663
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.480
Mike Friesenegger: Minds, um,

664
01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:23.100
Mike Friesenegger: I, I, I, I'm not, I think, you know,

665
01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.550
Mike Friesenegger: For an initial attempt that that's good but

666
01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:29.910
Mike Friesenegger: There should be efforts done with

667
01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:30.720
phil.tully@adp.com: With

668
01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:35.820
Mike Friesenegger: In each of the Linux distro pros and you know the open source options, you know,

669
01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:39.090
Mike Friesenegger: The open source distro options as well as the enterprise distro

670
01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.260
Mike Friesenegger: Vendors just to see if they have

671
01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:45.330
Mike Friesenegger: API's in place.

672
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:48.300
Mike Friesenegger: Or automation in place that could

673
01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:50.910
phil.tully@adp.com: Minimize the the

674
01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:52.710
Mike Friesenegger: The manual effort have

675
01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:53.280
Mike Friesenegger: Gotten

676
01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:54.570
Mike Friesenegger: These details together.

677
01:00:54.660 --> 01:01:07.170
Elizabeth Joseph: That's absolutely and and then a couple of things. So first we aren't married to keeping this code, we weren't going to just directly import this we were either we were probably if we were going to use the code at all. I mean, it's just some Python JavaScript. It's not

678
01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:12.480
Elizabeth Joseph: Difficult code at all. So we were going to either use it.

679
01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:21.210
Elizabeth Joseph: Or if we find a developer in the community who wants to work on it and they're like, I'm not using this code. It's terrible. We can be like, Okay, great. You should rewrite it. That's fine. And then we were going to

680
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:24.150
Elizabeth Joseph: split off the data source from

681
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:24.480
phil.tully@adp.com: The

682
01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:25.980
Elizabeth Joseph: Open Source project probably into

683
01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.430
Elizabeth Joseph: Two separate projects, just because the data probably shouldn't live with the source code.

684
01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:30.540
Elizabeth Joseph: And then

685
01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:38.880
Elizabeth Joseph: What's the point you bring up is exactly why I want to bring it to the open mainframe project because I want to have these discussions and I want the feedback from distributions, because that is an excellent idea.

686
01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:45.150
Elizabeth Joseph: And I hadn't really thought much about it. So that's why we want to bring this out into a big good broader

687
01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:52.800
Mike Friesenegger: Project. Well, thank you. I'm glad you thinking ahead and separating the the application and the data sources, I think, is a perfect and maybe

688
01:01:52.980 --> 01:02:00.900
Mike Friesenegger: Maybe the Linux distro is, you know, the Enterprise Linux sisters, as well as the other districts that can run maybe

689
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:02.730
Mike Friesenegger: They've got people that would be willing to

690
01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.220
Mike Friesenegger: Contribute to the data source piece of it. Yeah.

691
01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:10.230
Elizabeth Joseph: Because right now, it only searches, like the three officially supported. So it doesn't have Debbie and it doesn't have

692
01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:21.210
Elizabeth Joseph: Slack room slack where anything and I sort of envision also like incorporating things like you know this is like officially supported by IBM or this is like a community.

693
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:29.730
Elizabeth Joseph: Supported distribution or package. So I kind of like want to expand it. I don't actually have the live version. I don't have the link to the live version right now.

694
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.170
Elizabeth Joseph: And you might have it.

695
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:35.340
Elizabeth Joseph: But it's like a super simple search. If you look at the UI right now.

696
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:40.830
Elizabeth Joseph: And it doesn't really give you any details like you just search for something and it pops up and

697
01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.520
Elizabeth Joseph: It doesn't have so much

698
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.530
Mike Friesenegger: Thank you.

699
01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.350
phil.tully@adp.com: Any other questions or comments.

700
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.810
phil.tully@adp.com: Down. I mean, I'm always looking for software on it. So yeah.

701
01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:14.970
I keep hearing that so

702
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:17.640
phil.tully@adp.com: So I'm not gonna

703
01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.510
phil.tully@adp.com: Do we want to move this of next step which is bringing the incubation statuses see

704
01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:33.660
phil.tully@adp.com: You know, again, to move on to some of the can make those adjustments that we need to that would need to be made.

705
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:38.640
Elizabeth Joseph: That's what I'm hoping for.

706
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.520
phil.tully@adp.com: I'm going to propose that we moved in incubation status.

707
01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:47.220
phil.tully@adp.com: Me.

708
01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:58.440
phil.tully@adp.com: Do a motion to move the source code search tool, whatever we want to call it. I think that's first step and incubation status settle on a name.

709
01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:05.280
phil.tully@adp.com: And to put it into innovation status. Do we have a second

710
01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:07.860
Enyu Wang: Yeah, I love it.

711
01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:09.540
Enyu Wang: Okay.

712
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.230
phil.tully@adp.com: Can we take a roll call vote john yeah I'm

713
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:18.480
John Mertic: voting members. All in favor. Aye.

714
01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:19.860
Bob Dahlberg: Aye.

715
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.740
John Mertic: Any opposed, or abstain.

716
01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:31.860
John Mertic: Gang you've completed your third vote in the meeting.

717
01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.940
Congratulations.

718
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:37.830
Bob Dahlberg: THANK YOU, JOHN We all seem to be amenable, maybe you should ask for

719
01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:38.430
Bob Dahlberg: A raise

720
01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:45.390
phil.tully@adp.com: Money for the board. Yeah.

721
01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.330
John Mertic: Thank you Elizabeth, thank you for all of that.

722
01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:58.560
John Mertic: Um, I guess, is one sort of trailing thing and I figured I just give everyone a heads up, because this is probably coming down the pipe within

723
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:13.650
John Mertic: The next hour. There's a plane announcement. We're working with IBM and two quick initiatives here and I think it relates really nicely to the cobalt topic from earlier one is

724
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:17.460
John Mertic: A forum for connecting cobalt talent.

725
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:26.250
John Mertic: To some of these organizations that are needed of it right now it's on our discourse forum and you can take a look. We've already had.

726
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:41.610
John Mertic: A TON OF ACTIVITY audit and it's really just got started this morning. So definitely go check that out. And the other thing that we were getting going. Here is a cobalt technical questions forum and I putting the links to these in the chat.

727
01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:49.800
John Mertic: You will likely see an announcement here coming very quickly from the open mainframe project with support from Member our members and especially

728
01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.020
John Mertic: Folks like IBM and Broadcom and others.

729
01:05:53.280 --> 01:06:00.360
John Mertic: As you see that, feel free to share with your networks. And I think a big ass to everyone is that there's ways you can contribute to this forums that anyway.

730
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:08.820
John Mertic: That would be really most appreciative. I think we're all in the brawn a critical time now in the industry and just in our society in general and the way you make it through.

731
01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.500
John Mertic: These things is by pulling together.

732
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:18.660
John Mertic: And I've always done the mainframe community to be exceptional at that. So we're hoping this is a great opportunity as well.

733
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:29.730
John Mertic: There any questions, concerns about that. Happy to.

734
01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.550
John Mertic: Have been talked to them. He still got a couple of minutes till the end of the hour.

735
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:38.490
phil.tully@adp.com: Maybe just a couple of

736
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:43.350
18049181726: Words, Phil, I just wanted to wish everybody a

738
01:06:54.060 --> 01:07:05.910
18049181726: We're going to get through this craziness. One way or another, and everybody stay in touch. Let us know anybody who might need any kind of helper just

739
01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:23.160
18049181726: Sometimes, you know, I've noticed on some recent conference calls that executives who are usually very short and to the point are actually staying and the calls, because I think they have come to realize how

740
01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.960
phil.tully@adp.com: Important it is to

741
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:27.270
18049181726: Maybe talk and slow down a little bit.

742
01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:29.070
18049181726: So,

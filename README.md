# TSC Projects

Open Mainframe Project TSC seeks a resource open source projects supporting or looking to support mainframe, as well as a home for open source projects specifically targetting the mainframe. The TSC looks to ensure that projects targeting the mainframe have the support they need to be successful, and does not impose hard requirements on governance or licensing.

Below are some of the projects supported by the TSC, listed by [project stage](process/project_stages.md).

## Incubation

  * [z/VM Cloud Connector](projects/proposals/z:VM%20Cloud%20connector.md)

## Active

  * [Internship Program](projects/internship.md)
  * [Cloudstack on z/VM](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cloudstack-wg)
  * [ADE](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/ade)
  * [Zowe](https://github.com/zowe)

## Emeritus

  * *None*

The processes and policies for the TSC to manage incoming projects and project stages to be hosted by the TSC, as well as guidelines for projects, are in the [process section](process).

If you are looking for ideas on projects that can use help in supporting mainframe, review our [proposed project ideas](proposed.md) list.

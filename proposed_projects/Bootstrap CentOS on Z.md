# Bootstrap CentOS on Z

## Description
CentOS is a Linux distribution that provides a free, enterprise-class, community-supported computing platform functionally compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Currently it does not have an official support to s390x architecture, and there is desire in the community to establish one.

The Open Mainframe Project will provide infrastructure for testing and hosting the build environment for an s390x CentOS version.

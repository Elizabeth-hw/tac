# Blockchain ledger archiving

## Description
Blockchain entries cannot be deleted or changed once committed.  However, this would lead to blockchains growing indefinitely.  We can use your help, working with Petr Novotny at IBM to provide a blockchain archiving capability.

## Desirable Skills
High familiarity with blockchain concepts. Familiarity with the Hyperledger Fabric build of blockchain preferred. Familiarity with archiving solutions (open source or vendor based) preferred but not required. Computer programming background/skillset.

## Expected Outcome
A pilot solution for archiving blockchain data.

## Difficultly
Hard

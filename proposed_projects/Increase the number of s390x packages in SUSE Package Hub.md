# Increase the number of s390x packages in SUSE Package Hub

## Description
The goal of this project is to increase the number of popular open source community packages ready for install on s390x by building  and making the packages available in SUSE Package Hub. An intern will work with the Open Mainframe Project Technical Steering Committee to identify packages to be added to the s390x Package Hub repository. The intern with the mentors will review the package list and identify the package request submissions for a successful internship.  After the packages have been identified, an intern will work with the openSUSE community and SUSE engineers to submit package requests for approval in Package Hub.

## Additional Information
The package submission process can be reviewed at https://packagehub.suse.com/#contribute and https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Backports_Package_Submission_Process.

[SUSE Package Hub](https://packagehub.suse.com/) is a repository of packages that are built and maintained by a community of users and "packagers". The packages are SUSE approved and are built within the [openSUSE Factory](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory) project using the [Open Build Service](http://openbuildservice.org/). While the packages from the SUSE Package Hub are not officially supported by SUSE, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) remains supported and supportable when using these packages.  Package Hub contains packages for all architectures supported by SLES - AArch64, ppc64le, s390x and x86-64.

## Desirable Skills
* Basic knowledge of RPM package creation
* Willingness to learn about bulding RPM packages using the Open Build Service
* Willingness to learn about the Open Build Service and osc - the Command Line Interface to work with the Open Build Service
* Troubleshooting issues with building RPM packages for SLES s390x

## Expected Outcome
**The following numbers are suggestions and the final numbers will be decided by the intern and mentors.**
* Worked with the OMP TSC to identify 15 potential packages. An example is kubernetes and dependent packages.
* Reviewed and choose 10 packages that will be submission targets for SUSE Package Hub approval.
* Provide weekly documentation that outlines the efforts to get packages submitted for Package Hub approval.

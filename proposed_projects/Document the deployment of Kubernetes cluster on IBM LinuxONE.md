# Document the deployment of Kubernetes cluster on IBM LinuxONE

## Description
The goal of this project is to successfully build, deploy, document and demonstrate Kubernetes on several Linux distributions running on IBM LinuxONE. LinuxONE has [proven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWBNoIwGEjo) that it is an extremely scalable system for container deployments. Kubernetes is also proving itself as a leader for container orchestration. Combining Kubernetes and LinuxONE needs better documentation that explains the options available to install and configure Kubernetes on LinuxONE. 

## Additional Information
The Kubernetes deployments must be based on the latest version of the current release of Kubernetes. Selecting a kubernetes build from different repositories like [Kubernetes github](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.9.md), [Open Build Service](http://openbuildservice.org/), [Google Cloud Packages](https://packages.cloud.google.com/) is acceptable.  The deployments must use an IBM [tested and supported Linux](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/os/linux-tested-platforms) distributions.

## Desirable Skills
Have already deployed Kubernetes on distributed Linux distributions

## Expected Outcome
* At least one deployment of Kubernetes on each of the IBM tested and support Linux distributions.
* All steps for each Kubernetes deployment is documented.
* Work with the s390x Kubernetes maintainers to resolve any issues found during each deployment.
* Publish the documentation for each deployment on the Community pages of the Open Mainframe Project.
* OPTIONAL: Create videos of the deployments process that ends with showing a running Kubernetes cluster.

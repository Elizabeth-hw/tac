# Open Mainframe Project Summer Intern Program - 2018

Open Mainframe Project is accepting eight student interns during the summer of 2018 to work in the Linux and Open Source on Mainframe development community. Each intern will work closely with a mentor for the duration of his/her internship. For a list of suggested intern development projects, please see our [Project Ideas Page](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tsc/blob/master/proposed.md). Internship development projects do not need to be limited to ideas on this wiki page. If you have a great idea for a development activity for Linux and Open Source on Mainframe, you can submit the idea as part of your application and, if chosen, the Open Mainframe Project Internship Administrator will find a suitable mentor for you.

Each intern will work remotely from his/her location of choice. There is no physical work facility provided or required.

The Open Mainframe Project will also give the ability for each intern successfully completing the program to present their project at an industry conference. The Open Mainframe Project will provide a stipend for travel for each student. To help support the student for presenting, the project will provide professional resources and training to help build their presentation skills.
